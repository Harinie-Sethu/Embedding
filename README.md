# Embedding
We implement a frequency-based embedding modelling approach - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and compare it with the embeddings obtained using one of the variants of Word2vec, - CBOW implementation with Negative Sampling. The analysis will highlight the differences in the quality of embeddings obtained.
